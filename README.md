## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine categories. To support evaluation, we introduce **MARIS** (**Mar**ine Open-Vocabulary **I**nstance **S**egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for underwater OV segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen categories and 74 unseen categories. Although open-vocabulary (OV) segmentation has shown promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and semantic misalignment caused by lack of underwater class definitions. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components. The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (**GPEM**) leverages stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (**SAIM**) enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories.  Experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future underwater perception research.
